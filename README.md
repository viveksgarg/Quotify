# Quotify

Hi There! 
In the QUOTIFY App I have implemeted the following concepts:
-> ViewBinding 
-> ViewModel and ViewModelFactory 
-> I added the JSON file to Assets folder as the mock data and used gson converter to convert the 
   json data to my required data objects and then simply updated the data to the textview widgets.
   
-> I have tried to keep the App visually appealing.

In case of any suggestions/queries write to me at my socials available in my profile.
